Switching the screen display (while shooting/during playback)
You can change the display contents on the screen.
Histogram display
A histogram shows the luminance distribution, displaying how many pixels there are by luminance. It shows darker
toward the left and brighter toward the right.
The histogram changes depending on the exposure compensation.
A peak at the right or left end of the histogram indicates that the image has an overexposed or underexposed area,
respectively. You cannot correct such defects using a computer after shooting. Perform exposure compensation before
shooting as necessary.
Press the DISP (Display Setting) button.
Each time you press the DISP button, the screen display changes.
The displayed contents and their position are just a guideline, and may differ from the actual display.
During shooting
Display All Info. → No Disp. Info. → Histogram → Level → Graphic Display → Display All Info.
During playback
Display Info. → Histogram → No Disp. Info. → Display Info.
If the image has an overexposed or underexposed area, the corresponding section will blink on the histogram
display (overexposed/underexposed warning).
The settings for playback are also applied in [Auto Review].

cable from the camera and then reinsert it to recharge.
We recommend charging the battery pack in an ambient temperature of between 10 °C and 30 °C (50 °F and 86 °F).
The battery pack may not be effectively charged in temperatures outside this range.
When you connect this product and a laptop computer that is not connected to a power source, the laptop’s battery
charge may decrease. Do not charge this product using the laptop computer for too long.
Do not turn on/restart a computer, wake a computer from sleep mode, or turn off a computer while this product is
connected to the computer via USB cable. Doing so may cause a malfunction of this product. Disconnect the product
and the computer before performing the above operations.
We do not guarantee charging if you are using a self-built or modified computer.

48

--- Page 49 ---
The above charging time applies when charging a fully depleted battery pack at a temperature of 25 °C (77 °F). Charging
may take longer depending on conditions of use and circumstances.
Effective use of the battery pack
Battery performance decreases in low temperature environments. So in cold places, the operational time of the
battery pack is shorter. To ensure longer battery pack use, we recommend putting the battery pack in your pocket
close to your body to warm it up, and insert it in the product immediately before you start shooting. If there are any
metal objects such as keys in your pocket, be careful of causing a short-circuit.
The battery pack will run down quickly if you use the flash or continuous shooting function frequently, turn the power
on/off frequently, or set the monitor very bright.
We recommend preparing spare battery packs and taking trial shots before taking the actual shots.
If the battery terminal is dirty, you may not be able to turn on the product or the battery pack may not be properly
charged. In that case, clean the battery by lightly wiping off any dust using a soft cloth or a cotton swab.
How to store the battery pack
To maintain the battery pack’s function, charge the battery pack and then fully discharge it in the camera at least once a
year before storing it. Store the battery in a cool, dry place after removing it from the camera.
On battery life
The battery life is limited. If you use the same battery repeatedly, or use the same battery for a long period, the
battery capacity decreases gradually. If the available time of the battery is shortened significantly, it is probably time
to replace the battery pack with a new one.
The battery life varies according to how the battery pack is stored and the operating conditions and environment in
which each battery pack is used.

Since several images are stitched together, the stitched part may not be recorded smoothly in some cases.
When a light source such as a fluorescent light flickers, the brightness and color of a stitched image may not be consistent.
When the whole angle of panoramic shooting and the AE/AF locked angle are very different in brightness and focus, the shooting
may not be successful. If this happens, change AE/AF locked angle and shoot again.
The following situations are not suited for shooting Sweep Panorama:
Moving subjects.
Subjects that are too close to the product.
Subjects with continuously similar patterns, such as the sky, beach, or a lawn.
Subjects with constant change such as waves or water falls.

Color Space (still image)
The way colors are represented using combinations of numbers or the range of color reproduction is called “color
space.” You can change the color space depending on the purpose of the image.
Menu item details
sRGB:
This is the standard color space of the digital camera. Use [sRGB] in normal shooting, such as when you intend to print
out the images without any modification.
AdobeRGB:
This color space has a wide range of color reproduction. When a large part of the subject is vivid green or red, Adobe
RGB is effective. The file name of the recorded image starts with “_.”
Note
[AdobeRGB] is for applications or printers that support color management and DCF2.0 option color space. Images may not be
printed or viewed in the correct colors if you use applications or printers that do not support Adobe RGB.
When displaying images that were recorded with [AdobeRGB] on non-Adobe RGB-compliant devices, the images will be

During High Frame Rate shooting
Up to 8 faces of your subjects can be detected.
The product may not detect faces at all or may accidentally detect other objects as faces in some conditions.
If the product cannot detect a smile, adjust the Smile Detection Sensitivity.

Using flash (sold separately)
In dark environments, use the flash to light up the subject while shooting. Also use the flash to prevent camera-shake.
For details on the flash, refer to the instruction manual for the flash.
Note
You cannot use the flash when recording movies. (You can use an LED light when using a flash (sold separately) with an LED
light.)
Before attaching/removing an accessory such as a flash to/from the Multi Interface Shoe, turn off the product first. When
attaching an accessory, make sure that the accessory is fixed securely to the product.
Do not use the Multi Interface Shoe with a commercially available flash that applies voltage of 250 V or more or has the reverse
polarity of the camera. Doing so may cause a malfunction.
When using flash to shoot pictures of yourself, be careful not to look directly at the light, because the flash will go off at a close
distance.
When shooting with an external flash, light and dark stripes may appear on the image if the shutter speed is set to faster than
1/4000 seconds. If this occurs, Sony recommends shooting in the manual flash mode and setting the flash level to 1/2 or higher.
For details on compatible accessories for the Multi Interface Shoe, visit the Sony website, or consult your Sony dealer or local
authorized Sony service facility.
Attach the flash (sold separately) to the product.

Record Setting :
Selects the frame rate of the movie from [60p 50M]/[50p 50M], [30p 50M]/[25p 50M], and [24p 50M*].  
* Only when [NTSC/PAL Selector] is set to NTSC.
Frame Rate :
Selects the shooting frame rate from [240fps]/[250fps], [480fps]/[500fps], and [960fps]/[1000fps].
Priority Setting :
Select from [Quality Priority] which prioritizes the image quality and [Shoot Time Priority] which prioritizes the duration of
time of the movie.
REC Timing :
Selects whether to record for a set amount of time after you press the MOVIE button ([Start Trigger]), or for a set amount
of time until you press the MOVIE button ([End Trigger]/[End Trigger Half]).
Frame rate
In super-slow-motion movie shooting, the camera shoots at a faster shutter speed than the number of shooting frames
per second. For example, when [
Frame Rate] is set to [960fps], the shutter speed per frame will be faster than
approx. 1/1000 second in order to shoot 960 frames per second. To maintain this shutter speed, sufficient ambient light is
necessary during shooting. If the ambient light is insufficient, the ISO sensitivity will become higher, resulting in more
noise.
Shortest shooting distance
The image becomes out of focus when the subject is too close, such as during macro shooting. Shoot from the shortest
shooting distance (W side: approximately 5 cm (0.16 ft), T side: approximately 30 cm (0.98 ft) (from the lens)) or further.
Timing of recording
Depending on the [
REC Timing] setting, the relationship between when you press the MOVIE button and the
recorded section of the movie is as shown below.
[Start Trigger] 
Movie capturing (shooting) starts when the MOVIE button is pressed. When the MOVIE button is pressed again, or when
the recordable duration of time has elapsed, movie capturing ends and the camera starts to record the captured movie to
the memory card.
(A): The point when the MOVIE button is pressed 
(B): Recorded section 
(C): Recording to memory card in progress (You cannot start the next session of shooting.)
[End Trigger]/[End Trigger Half] 
Buffering (temporarily capturing a movie on the camera) starts once the camera enters the shooting standby. When the
time has elapsed, movie capturing ends and the camera starts to record the captured movie to the memory card. 
When [
REC Timing] is set to [End Trigger] or [End Trigger Half]:  
Movie capturing ends and the camera starts to record the captured movie to the memory card.
189

--- Page 190 ---
captured data fills the buffering capacity, old data is overwritten sequentially. When you press the MOVIE button, the
camera starts to record a movie of the set duration calculated retroactively from that point on the memory card.
With [End Trigger], a movie of the maximum possible duration is recorded. With [End Trigger Half], a movie of half
the maximum possible duration is recorded. With [End Trigger Half], the time it takes to record to the memory card is
also shorter than with [End Trigger].

The default settings [PP1] through [PP10] for movies have been set in advance in the camera based on various shooting
conditions.
MENU → 
 (Camera Settings1) → [Picture Profile] → desired setting.
PP1:
Example setting using [Movie] gamma.

Items of the picture profile
Black Level
Sets the black level. (–15 to +15)
Gamma
Selects a gamma curve.
Movie: Standard gamma curve for movies
Still: Standard gamma curve for still images
Cine1: Softens the contrast in dark parts and emphasizes gradation in bright parts to produce a relaxed color movie.
(equivalent to HG4609G33)
Cine2: Similar to [Cine1] but optimized for editing with up to 100% video signal. (equivalent to HG4600G30)
ITU709: Gamma curve that corresponds to ITU709.
ITU709(800%): Gamma curve for confirming scenes on the assumption of shooting using [S-Log2] or [S-Log3].
S-Log2: Gamma curve for [S-Log2]. This setting is based on the assumption that the picture will be processed after
shooting.
S-Log3: Gamma curve for [S-Log3] with more similar features to film. This setting is based on the assumption that the
picture will be processed after shooting.
HLG: Gamma curve for HDR recording. Equivalent to the HDR standard Hybrid Log-Gamma, ITU-R BT.2100.
HLG1: Gamma curve for HDR recording. Emphasizes noise reduction. However, shooting is restricted to a narrower
dynamic range than with [HLG2] or [HLG3].
HLG2: Gamma curve for HDR recording. Provides a balance of dynamic range and noise reduction.
HLG3: Gamma curve for HDR recording. Wider dynamic range than [HLG2]. However, noise may increase.
[HLG1], [HLG2], and [HLG3] all apply a gamma curve with the same characteristics, but each offers a different
balance between dynamic range and noise reduction. Each has a different maximum video output level, as follows:
[HLG1]: approx. 87%, [HLG2]: approx. 95%, [HLG3]: approx. 100%.
Black Gamma
Corrects gamma in low intensity areas.
[Black Gamma] is fixed at “0” and cannot be adjusted when [Gamma] is set to [HLG], [HLG1], [HLG2], or [HLG3].
Range: Selects the correcting range. (Wide / Middle / Narrow)
Level: Sets the correcting level. (-7 (maximum black compression) to +7 (maximum black stretch))

To reset the picture profile to the default setting
You can reset the picture profile to the default setting. You cannot reset all picture profile settings at once.
MENU → 
 (Camera Settings1) → [Picture Profile] → [Reset].
Note
Since the parameters are shared for movie and still images, adjust the value when you change the shooting mode.
If you develop RAW images with shooting settings, the following settings are not reflected:
Black Level
Black Gamma
Knee
Color Depth
When the [
Record Setting] is [120p 100M]/[100p 100M] or [120p 60M]/[100p 60M], [Black Gamma] is fixed at “0” and cannot
be adjusted.
If you change [Gamma], the available ISO value range changes.
When using S-Log2 or S-Log3 gamma, the noise becomes more noticeable compared to when using other gammas. If the noise
still is significant even after processing pictures, it may be improved by shooting with a brighter setting. However, the dynamic
range becomes narrower accordingly when you shoot with a brighter setting. We recommend checking the picture in advance by
test shooting when using S-Log2 or S-Log3.
Setting [ITU709(800%)], [S-Log2] or [S-Log3] may cause an error in the white balance custom setup. In this case, perform
custom setup with a gamma other than [ITU709(800%)], [S-Log2], or [S-Log3] first, and then reselect [ITU709(800%)], [S-Log2],
or [S-Log3] gamma.
Setting [ITU709(800%)], [S-Log2] or [S-Log3] disables the [Black Level] setting.
If you set [Slope] to +5 in [Manual Set] under [Knee], [Knee] will be disabled.
S-Gamut, S-Gamut3.Cine, and S-Gamut3 are color spaces exclusive to Sony. However, this camera's S-Gamut setting does not
support the whole S-Gamut color space; it is a setting to achieve a color reproduction equivalent to S-Gamut.

Gamma Disp. Assist
Movies with S-Log gamma are assumed to be processed after shooting in order to make use of the wide dynamic range.
Movies with the HLG gamma are assumed to be displayed on HDR-compatible monitors. They are therefore displayed in
low contrast during shooting, and may be difficult to monitor. However, you can use the [Gamma Disp. Assist] function to
reproduce contrast equivalent to that of normal gamma. In addition, [Gamma Disp. Assist] can also be applied when
playing back movies on the camera's monitor.
Menu item details
Off:
Does not apply [Gamma Disp. Assist].
Auto:
Displays movies with an [S-Log2→709(800%)] effect when the gamma set in [Picture Profile] is [S-Log2], and with an [S-
Log3→709(800%)] effect when the gamma is set to [S-Log3]. Displays movies with an [HLG(BT.2020)] effect when the
gamma set in [Picture Profile] is [HLG], [HLG1], [HLG2] or [HLG3], and [Color Mode] is set to [BT.2020].  
Displays movies with an [HLG(709)] effect when the gamma set in [Picture Profile] is [HLG], [HLG1], [HLG2] or [HLG3],
and [Color Mode] is set to [709].
S-Log2→709(800%):
Displays movies with an S-Log2 gamma reproducing contrast equivalent to ITU709 (800%).
S-Log3→709(800%):
Displays movies with an S-Log3 gamma reproducing contrast equivalent to ITU709 (800%).
 HLG(BT.2020):
Displays movies after adjusting the image quality of the monitor to a quality that is almost the same as when movies are
displayed on an [HLG(BT.2020)] compatible monitor.
 HLG(709):
Displays movies after adjusting the image quality of the monitor to a quality that is almost the same as when movies are
displayed on an [HLG(709)] compatible monitor.
Note
Movies in the XAVC S 4K or XAVC S HD format with the [HLG], [HLG1], [HLG2], or [HLG3] gamma are displayed with an
[HLG(BT.2020)] effect or [HLG(709)] effect depending on the movie’s gamma value and color mode. In other situations, movies
are displayed according to the gamma setting and color mode setting in [Picture Profile].
[Gamma Disp. Assist] is not applied to movies when displayed on a TV or monitor connected to the camera.

Color Space (still image)
The way colors are represented using combinations of numbers or the range of color reproduction is called “color
space.” You can change the color space depending on the purpose of the image.
Menu item details
sRGB:
This is the standard color space of the digital camera. Use [sRGB] in normal shooting, such as when you intend to print
out the images without any modification.
AdobeRGB:
This color space has a wide range of color reproduction. When a large part of the subject is vivid green or red, Adobe
RGB is effective. The file name of the recorded image starts with “_.”
Note
[AdobeRGB] is for applications or printers that support color management and DCF2.0 option color space. Images may not be
printed or viewed in the correct colors if you use applications or printers that do not support Adobe RGB.

When the [
Record Setting] is [120p 100M]/[100p 100M] or [120p 60M]/[100p 60M], [Black Gamma] is fixed at “0” and cannot
be adjusted.
If you change [Gamma], the available ISO value range changes.
When using S-Log2 or S-Log3 gamma, the noise becomes more noticeable compared to when using other gammas. If the noise
still is significant even after processing pictures, it may be improved by shooting with a brighter setting. However, the dynamic
range becomes narrower accordingly when you shoot with a brighter setting. We recommend checking the picture in advance by
test shooting when using S-Log2 or S-Log3.
Setting [ITU709(800%)], [S-Log2] or [S-Log3] may cause an error in the white balance custom setup. In this case, perform
custom setup with a gamma other than [ITU709(800%)], [S-Log2], or [S-Log3] first, and then reselect [ITU709(800%)], [S-Log2],
or [S-Log3] gamma.
Setting [ITU709(800%)], [S-Log2] or [S-Log3] disables the [Black Level] setting.
If you set [Slope] to +5 in [Manual Set] under [Knee], [Knee] will be disabled.
S-Gamut, S-Gamut3.Cine, and S-Gamut3 are color spaces exclusive to Sony. However, this camera's S-Gamut setting does not
support the whole S-Gamut color space; it is a setting to achieve a color reproduction equivalent to S-Gamut.

Selects the shooting frame rate from [240fps]/[250fps], [480fps]/[500fps], and [960fps]/[1000fps].
Priority Setting :
Select from [Quality Priority] which prioritizes the image quality and [Shoot Time Priority] which prioritizes the duration of
time of the movie.
REC Timing :
Selects whether to record for a set amount of time after you press the MOVIE button ([Start Trigger]), or for a set amount
of time until you press the MOVIE button ([End Trigger]/[End Trigger Half]).
Frame rate
In super-slow-motion movie shooting, the camera shoots at a faster shutter speed than the number of shooting frames
per second. For example, when [
Frame Rate] is set to [960fps], the shutter speed per frame will be faster than
approx. 1/1000 second in order to shoot 960 frames per second. To maintain this shutter speed, sufficient ambient light is
necessary during shooting. If the ambient light is insufficient, the ISO sensitivity will become higher, resulting in more
noise.
Shortest shooting distance
The image becomes out of focus when the subject is too close, such as during macro shooting. Shoot from the shortest
shooting distance (W side: approximately 5 cm (0.16 ft), T side: approximately 30 cm (0.98 ft) (from the lens)) or further.
Timing of recording
Depending on the [
REC Timing] setting, the relationship between when you press the MOVIE button and the
recorded section of the movie is as shown below.
[Start Trigger] 
Movie capturing (shooting) starts when the MOVIE button is pressed. When the MOVIE button is pressed again, or when
the recordable duration of time has elapsed, movie capturing ends and the camera starts to record the captured movie to
the memory card.
(A): The point when the MOVIE button is pressed 
(B): Recorded section 
(C): Recording to memory card in progress (You cannot start the next session of shooting.)
[End Trigger]/[End Trigger Half] 
Buffering (temporarily capturing a movie on the camera) starts once the camera enters the shooting standby. When the
time has elapsed, movie capturing ends and the camera starts to record the captured movie to the memory card. 
When [
REC Timing] is set to [End Trigger] or [End Trigger Half]:  
Movie capturing ends and the camera starts to record the captured movie to the memory card.
417

--- Page 418 ---
captured data fills the buffering capacity, old data is overwritten sequentially. When you press the MOVIE button, the
camera starts to record a movie of the set duration calculated retroactively from that point on the memory card.
With [End Trigger], a movie of the maximum possible duration is recorded. With [End Trigger Half], a movie of half
the maximum possible duration is recorded. With [End Trigger Half], the time it takes to record to the memory card is
also shorter than with [End Trigger].
End Trigger
End Trigger Half
(A): The point when the MOVIE button is pressed 
(B): Recorded section 
(C): Recording to memory card in progress (You cannot start the next session of shooting.) 
(D): Buffering in progress 
To redo shooting
You can cancel recording by selecting [Cancel] on the screen. However, the movie recorded up to the point you
cancelled will be saved.

The playback speed will vary as below depending on the assigned [

Gamma Disp. Assist
Movies with S-Log gamma are assumed to be processed after shooting in order to make use of the wide dynamic range.
Movies with the HLG gamma are assumed to be displayed on HDR-compatible monitors. They are therefore displayed in
low contrast during shooting, and may be difficult to monitor. However, you can use the [Gamma Disp. Assist] function to
reproduce contrast equivalent to that of normal gamma. In addition, [Gamma Disp. Assist] can also be applied when
playing back movies on the camera's monitor.

of recording as the frame frequency of the NTSC image signal is approximately 29.97 frames per second. Drop frame corrects this gap to make
the time code and actual time equal. In drop frame, the first 2 frame numbers are removed every minute except for every tenth minute. The time

Precautions
Refer also to “Notes on use” in the Startup Guide (supplied) for this product.
On the data specifications described in this manual
The data on performance and specifications in this manual are based on an ordinary ambient temperature of 25ºC
(77°F), except where otherwise indicated.
For the battery pack, the data are based on a battery pack that was fully charged until the charge lamp turned off.
On operating temperatures
Shooting in extremely cold or hot environments that exceed the operating temperature range is not recommended.
Under high ambient temperatures, the temperature of the camera rises quickly.
When the temperature of the camera rises, the image quality may deteriorate. It is recommended that you wait until
the temperature of the camera drops before continuing to shoot.
Depending on the camera and battery temperature, the camera may become unable to record movies or the power
may turn off automatically to protect the camera. A message will be displayed on the screen before the power turns
off or you can no longer record movies. In this case, leave the power off and wait until the camera and battery
temperature goes down. If you turn on the power without letting the camera and battery cool sufficiently, the power
may turn off again, or you may still be unable to record movies.
Notes on recording for long periods of time or recording 4K movies
Especially during 4K movie shooting, the recording time may be shorter under low temperature conditions. Warm up the
battery pack or replace it with a new battery.
Notes on playing movies on other devices
XAVC S movies can be played back only on XAVC S-supported devices.
Notes on recording/playback
Before you start recording, make a trial recording to make sure that the camera is working correctly.
Playback of images recorded with your product on other equipment and playback of images recorded or edited with
other equipment on your product are not guaranteed.
Sony can provide no guarantees in the event of failure to record, or loss of or damage to recorded images or audio
data, due to a malfunction of the camera or recording media, etc. We recommend backing up important data.
Once you format the memory card, all the data recorded on the memory card will be deleted and cannot be restored.
Before formatting, copy the data to a computer or other device.
Backing up memory cards
Data may be corrupted in the following cases. Be sure to back up the data for protection.
When the memory card is removed, the USB cable is disconnected, or the product is turned off in the middle of a
read or write operation.
When the memory card is used in locations subject to static electricity or electrical noise.
Database file error
If you insert a memory card that does not contain an image database file into the product and turn on the power, the
product automatically creates an image database file using some of the memory card’s capacity. The process may
take a long time and you cannot operate the product until the process is completed.
544

--- Page 545 ---
If a database file error occurs, export all images to your computer using PlayMemories Home, and then format the
memory card using this product.
Do not use/store the product in the following places
In an extremely hot, cold or humid place  
In places such as in a car parked in the sun, the camera body may become deformed and this may cause a
malfunction.
Storing under direct sunlight or near a heater  
The camera body may become discolored or deformed, and this may cause a malfunction.
In a location subject to rocking vibration  
It may cause malfunctions and an inability to record data. In addition, the recording media may become unusable,
and recorded data may be corrupted.
Near strong magnetic place
In sandy or dusty places  
Be careful not to let sand or dust get into the product. This may cause the product to malfunction, and in some cases
this malfunction cannot be repaired.
In places with high humidity  
This may cause the lens to mold.
In areas where strong radio waves or radiation are being emitted  
Recording and playback may not function correctly.
On moisture condensation
If the product is brought directly from a cold to a warm location, moisture may condense inside or outside the
product. This moisture condensation may cause a malfunction of the product.
To prevent moisture condensation when you bring the product directly from a cold to a warm location, first put it in a
plastic bag and seal it to prevent air from entering. Wait for about an hour until the temperature of the product has
reached the ambient temperature.
If moisture condensation occurs, turn off the product and wait about an hour for the moisture to evaporate. Note that
if you attempt to shoot with moisture remaining inside the lens, you will be unable to record clear images.
Precaution on carrying
Do not hold, hit, or apply excessive force to the following parts, if your camera is equipped with them. Also, take care
to avoid getting your fingers or hand caught in the parts.
The lens part
The movable monitor part
The movable flash part
The movable viewfinder part
Do not carry the camera with the tripod attached. This may cause the tripod socket hole to break.
Do not sit down in a chair or other place with the camera in the back pocket of your trousers or skirt, as this may
cause malfunction or damage the camera.
Notes on handling the product
Before you connect the cable to the terminal, be sure to check the orientation of the terminal. Then, insert the cable
straight. Do not insert or remove the cable forcefully. This may cause the terminal part to break.
The camera uses magnetic parts including magnets. Do not bring objects affected by magnetism, including credit
cards and floppy disks, close to the camera.
The recorded image may be different from the image you monitored before recording.
On storing
For lens-integrated cameras  
Always attach the lens cap when you are not using the camera. (Only for models supplied with a lens cap)
For interchangeable-lens cameras 
Always attach the lens front cap or body cap when you are not using the camera. To prevent dust or debris from
getting inside the camera, remove dust from the body cap before attaching it to the camera.
545

--- Page 546 ---
If the camera is dirty after use, clean it. Water, sand, dust, salt, etc. left in the camera may cause a malfunction.
Notes on using lenses
When using the power zoom lens, be careful not to get your fingers or any other objects caught in the lens. (Only for
models with a power zoom feature or interchangeable lens cameras)
If you must place the camera under a light source such as sunlight, attach the lens cap to the camera. (Only for
models supplied with a lens cap or interchangeable lens cameras)
When you shoot with backlighting, keep the sun sufficiently far away from the angle of view. Otherwise, the sunlight
may enter the focus inside the camera and cause smoke or fire. Even if the sun is slightly away from the angle of
view, it may still cause smoke or fire.
Do not directly expose the lens to beams such as laser beams. That may damage the image sensor and cause the
camera to malfunction.
If the subject is too close, the image may show any dust or fingerprints on the lens. Wipe the lens with a soft cloth,
etc.
Notes on the flash (Only for models with a flash)
Keep your fingers away from the flash. The light-emitting part may get hot.
Remove any dirt from the surface of the flash. Dirt on the surface of the flash may emit smoke or burn due to heat
generated by the emission of light. If there is dirt/dust, clean it off with a soft cloth.
Restore the flash to its original position after using it. Make sure that the flash portion is not sticking up. (Only for
models with a movable flash)
Notes on the Multi Interface Shoe (Only for models with a Multi Interface Shoe)
When attaching or detaching accessories such as an external flash to the Multi Interface Shoe, first turn the power to
OFF. When attaching the accessory, confirm that it is firmly fastened to the camera.
Do not use the Multi Interface Shoe with a commercially available flash that applies voltages of 250 V or more or has
the opposite polarity of the camera. It may cause a malfunction.
Notes on the viewfinder and flash (Only for models with a viewfinder or a flash)
Take care that your finger is not in the way when pushing the viewfinder or flash down. (Only for models with a
movable viewfinder or a movable flash)
If water, dust or sand adheres to the viewfinder or flash unit, it may cause a malfunction. (Only for models with a
movable viewfinder or a movable flash)
Notes on the viewfinder (Only for models with a viewfinder)
When shooting with the viewfinder, you may experience symptoms such as eyestrain, fatigue, travel sickness, or
nausea. We recommend that you take a break at regular intervals when you are shooting with the viewfinder.  
In case you may feel uncomfortable, refrain from using the viewfinder until your condition recovers, and consult your
doctor if necessary.
Do not forcibly push down the viewfinder when the eyepiece is pulled out. It may cause a malfunction. (Only for
models with a movable viewfinder and an eyepiece that can be pulled out)
If you pan the camera while looking into the viewfinder or move your eyes around, the image in the viewfinder may
be distorted or the color of the image may change. This is a characteristic of the lens or display device and is not a
malfunction. When you shoot an image, we recommend that you look at the center area of the viewfinder.
The image may be slightly distorted near the corners of the viewfinder. This is not a malfunction. When you want to
see the full composition with all its details, you can also use the monitor.
If you use the camera in a cold location, the image may have a trailing appearance. This is not a malfunction.
Notes on the monitor
Do not press against the monitor. The monitor may be discolored and that may cause a malfunction.
If the monitor has drops of water or other liquids on it, wipe it with a soft cloth. If the monitor stays wet, the surface of
the monitor may change or deteriorate. This may cause a malfunction.
If you use the camera in a cold location, the image may have a trailing appearance. This is not a malfunction.

Recordable movie times
The table below shows the approximate total recording times using a memory card formatted with this camera. The
values may vary depending on the shooting conditions and the type of memory card used.
The recording times for when [
File Format] is set to [XAVC S 4K] and [XAVC S HD] are recording times when
shooting with [
Proxy Recording] set to [Off].
(h (hour), min (minute))
The duration of time available for movie recording varies depending on the file format/recording settings for movies,
memory card, ambient temperature, Wi-Fi network environment, condition of the camera before you start recording,
and condition of the charging of the battery.  
The maximum continuous recording time for a single movie shooting session is approximately 13 hours. When
recording XAVC S 4K or XAVC S HD movies in 120p/ 100p, the amount of time available for continuous recording is
approximately 5 minutes (a product specification limit). However, when [Auto Power OFF Temp.] is set to [High], you
can record movies continuously for over 5 minutes.
Note
The recordable time of movies varies because the camera is equipped with VBR (Variable Bit-Rate), which automatically adjusts
image quality depending on the shooting scene. When you record a fast-moving subject, the image is clearer but the recordable
time is shorter because more memory is required for recording. The recordable time also varies depending on the shooting
conditions, the subject or the image quality/size settings.
The times shown are recordable times using a Sony memory card.

Notes on continuous movie recording
High-quality movie recording and high-speed continuous shooting require large amounts of power. Therefore, if you
continue to shoot, the temperature inside the camera will rise, especially that of the image sensor. In such cases, the
camera will turn off automatically because the surface of the camera is heated to a high temperature or the high
temperature affects the quality of the images or the internal mechanism of the camera.
The duration of time available for continuous movie recording when the camera records with the default settings after
the power has been turned off for a while is as follows. The values indicate the continuous time from when the
camera starts recording until the camera stops recording.
When [Auto Power OFF Temp.] is set to [Standard]
When [Auto Power OFF Temp.] is set to [High]
XAVC S HD (60p 50M/50p 50M, when the camera is not connected via Wi-Fi)
XAVC S 4K (24p 60M/25p 60M, when the camera is not connected via Wi-Fi)
The duration of time available for movie recording varies with the temperature, file format/record setting for movies,
Wi-Fi network environment, or condition of the camera before you start recording. If you frequently recompose or
shoot images after the power is turned on, the temperature inside the camera will rise and the recording time
available will be shorter.
If 
 (Overheating warning) appears, the temperature of the camera has risen.
If the camera stops movie recording due to a high temperature, leave it for some time with the power turned off. Start
recording after the temperature inside the camera drops fully.
If you observe the following points, you will be able to record movies for longer periods of time.
Keep the camera out of direct sunlight.
Turn the camera off when it is not being used.
When [
File Format] is set to [AVCHD], the file size of movies is limited to approx. 2 GB. If the movie file size
reaches approx. 2 GB during recording, a new movie file will be created automatically.

AVCHD format
The AVCHD format was developed for high-definition digital video cameras when recording an HD (High-Definition)
signal using high-efficiency compression coding technology. The MPEG-4 AVC/H.264 format is used to compress video
data, and the Dolby Digital or Linear PCM system is used to compress audio data. 
The MPEG-4 AVC/H.264 format is capable of compressing images at higher efficiency than that of the conventional
image compressing format.
As the AVCHD format uses compression coding technology, the picture may be unstable in scenes where the screen,
angle of view, or brightness, etc. change drastically, but this is not a malfunction.
